            <p>An old project made by me when I was still learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By having JavaScript, this project was the first time I touched on introducing programming logic onto a web page. The purpose of this is to calculate how long, on average, it may take someone to read an entire book. As an extra challenge, I have also made the webpage in Arabic.</p>
